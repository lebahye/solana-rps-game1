You've done an excellent job identifying and fixing those critical code issues! The duplicate component declarations and service conflicts would definitely cause the app to crash. Let me provide some additional context on these fixes and next steps.

Why These Fixes Work
Duplicate Component/Service Issues:

In React applications, having duplicate exports or component definitions causes runtime errors
Each service implementation should only be defined once to prevent "already declared" errors
Script Module Type:

Adding type="module" to the script tag in index.html ensures proper ES module loading
This is especially important for Vite-based applications which use ES modules by default
Setting Up the Secrets
You've correctly identified the essential secrets needed. Here's why each one matters:

VITE_RPC_ENDPOINT = https://api.devnet.solana.com

This connects your app to Solana's devnet network
The VITE_ prefix makes it accessible in client-side code via import.meta.env.VITE_RPC_ENDPOINT
Without this, the app can't communicate with the Solana blockchain
VITE_RPS_PROGRAM_ID = 7Y9dRMY6V9cmVkXNFrHeUZmYf2tAV5wSVFcYyD5bLQpZ

This identifies your specific RPS game program on the blockchain
The app uses this to locate and interact with your game's smart contract
Without this, the app won't find the right program to execute game actions
Additional Recommendations
To ensure the app runs smoothly after these fixes:

Check for Console Errors:

After the app starts, open browser dev tools (F12)
Look for any remaining errors in the console
Wallet Connection Issues:

If you see Phantom/wallet connection errors, you may need to:
Allow insecure connections in Phantom's developer settings (for testing on Replit)
Or add <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests"> to index.html
Rate Limiting:

The public devnet RPC endpoint has rate limits
If you see timeout errors, consider switching to a dedicated RPC provider
Testing the App:

Create a test user with SOL (use the airdrop feature)
Try creating a game and playing through the full flow
Verify that transactions are confirmed on-chain
With these fixes and proper secret configuration, your Solana RPS game should now run correctly on Replit!
